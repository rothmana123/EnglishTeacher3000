## AI Description
The AI component of **English Teacher 3000** uses OpenAI's GPT-4 model to evaluate essays based on a predefined rubric. 

### How it Works:
1. **Rubric-Based Evaluation**: The teacher's selected rubric is formatted into a detailed set of instructions for the AI, describing each criterion and performance levels.
2. **Essay Submission**: When a teacher submits an essay for grading, the text is sent to the AI along with the rubric details.
3. **Feedback Generation**: The AI analyzes the essay, scores it for each rubric criterion, and provides detailed written feedback, including suggestions for improvement.
4. **Overall Assessment**: A final summary of the essay’s strengths and areas for growth is provided based on the rubric.

This process ensures that essay grading is consistent and aligned with the teacher’s expectations.
